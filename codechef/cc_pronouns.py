Logic I used against the required logic
 The logic within the if i in v: block is overly complex and doesn't correctly identify four or more consecutive consonants. 
 You're trying to find the difference between the indices of vowels, which isn't the right approach. 
 You should instead count consecutive consonants.
'''
'''
Solution Hint:
We run a loop through the string S and maintain a counter - 'count'
As we go through the loop, we use the following conditions:
If S[i] == 'a' OR 'e' OR 'i' OR 'o' OR 'u', then we reset value of count to 0
If S[i]â‰  either of 'a' OR 'e' OR 'i' OR 'o' OR 'u', then we increment the counter as count = count + 1
It means that the loop as encountered 4 consecutive consonants
If value of count reaches 4, we should break out of the loop and output 'NO'
If value of count never reaches 4, we should output 'YES'
